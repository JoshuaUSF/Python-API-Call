# Python-API-Call

This is a basic program that uses the requests module to call an API that tries to guess your age based on your name. The exciting part, in my opinion, is that it tells you how many times a particular entry has been queried. My challenge to you will be to run this and try to find a real name or object that hasn't been tried at least once. Go crazy with it and have a good time.
