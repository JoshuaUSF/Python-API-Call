This is where I will post and keep track of any changes I might want to make in the future.

- Update scores to save top 5 results
    Reason: This would be very cool. The game is fun and I'm incredibly proud of it, but this would give it far more depth

- Update how scores are displayed
    Reason: The aestetics on this could be polished a lot. This would be a welcome change.

- Integrate with Postgres to save highest found scores of all-time
    Reason: This would be a really cool way to display my ability to use Postgres.

- Integrate with web development to extend project
    Reason: Integrating any project with web development is always a really big goal of mine.
